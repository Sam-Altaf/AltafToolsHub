      question: "How random are the generated passwords?",
      answer: "We use cryptographically secure random number generation (crypto.getRandomValues) to ensure truly random, unpredictable passwords that meet the highest security standards.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a password strong?",
      answer: "Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, avoid common patterns, and are unique for each account. Our strength meter evaluates these factors.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the ideal password length?",
      answer: "Security experts recommend at least 12-16 characters for important accounts. Longer passwords (20+ characters) provide even better security. Length is more important than complexity for password strength.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize password requirements?",
      answer: "Yes, you can adjust length (4-50 characters) and choose which character types to include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. This helps meet specific website or application requirements.",
      category: "Features"
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to generate passwords online?",
      answer: "Yes, our generator is completely safe because it runs entirely in your browser. No passwords are sent to any server, stored, or logged. Each password is generated locally on your device.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use the same password for multiple accounts?",
      answer: "Never use the same password for multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, all accounts with the same password become vulnerable. Generate unique passwords for each account.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I create memorable but secure passwords?",
      answer: "Use passphrases: combine 4-6 random words with numbers and symbols. For example: 'Coffee#Laptop7$Mountain!Beach'. These are easier to remember than random characters but equally secure.",
      category: "Tips"
    },
    {
      question: "What's two-factor authentication and why use it?",
      answer: "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra security layer beyond passwords. Even if your password is compromised, attackers can't access your account without the second factor (usually a phone app or SMS code).",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "Can password generators be hacked?",
      answer: "Our generator cannot be hacked to reveal generated passwords because nothing is stored or transmitted. Each password exists only in your browser's memory and disappears when you navigate away.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "Why avoid dictionary words in passwords?",
      answer: "Hackers use dictionary attacks that try common words and phrases. Random character combinations are exponentially harder to crack than dictionary words, even with substitutions like @ for 'a'.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "How should I store my generated passwords?",
      answer: "We recommend using a reputable password manager like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass. Never write passwords in plain text files or sticky notes. Password managers encrypt your data for security.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I change my passwords?",
      answer: "Change passwords immediately if there's a security breach. Otherwise, security experts now recommend using strong, unique passwords rather than frequent changes, unless required by your organization.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most common password mistakes?",
      answer: "Common mistakes include: using personal information (birthdays, names), simple patterns (123456, qwerty), reusing passwords, short passwords (<8 characters), and writing passwords in unsecure places.",
      category: "Tips"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate passwords for specific requirements?",
      answer: "Yes! Adjust the settings to meet specific requirements. For example, some sites don't allow symbols - just uncheck that option. Need exactly 8 characters? Set the slider to 8.",
      category: "Features"
    },
    {
      question: "How does the password strength meter work?",
      answer: "Our strength meter analyzes length, character variety, and patterns. It checks for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and common patterns to give you real-time feedback on password security.",
