Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized document digitization, making it possible to extract editable text from PDFs, scanned documents, and images instantly. Whether you're digitizing archives, extracting data for analysis, or making documents searchable, this comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about text extraction in 2025.

## Quick Answer: How to Extract Text from PDFs

**To extract text from PDF:** Upload your PDF to an OCR tool, select extraction options (maintain formatting, plain text, or structured data), choose language settings for accuracy, process the document (typically 5-30 seconds), then download extracted text in your preferred format (TXT, DOCX, or searchable PDF). Modern OCR achieves 99%+ accuracy for clear documents.
