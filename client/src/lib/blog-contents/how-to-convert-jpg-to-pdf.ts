## Understanding Image-to-PDF Conversion

### How Conversion Works

The JPG to PDF conversion process involves:

\`\`\`
JPG Image Data → PDF Container → Embedded Image Stream → PDF Document
Multiple JPGs → Page Assembly → Structured PDF with Multiple Pages
\`\`\`

### Image Quality Considerations

| Setting | DPI | Quality | Use Case | File Size |
|---------|-----|---------|----------|-----------|
| Web Quality | 72 | Good | Email, web viewing | Smallest |
| Standard | 150 | Better | General printing | Moderate |

### Problem: Wrong Page Order
**Solution:** Rename files with numerical prefixes (001_, 002_) or use drag-and-drop reordering before conversion.

### Problem: Images Don't Fit Page Properly
**Solution:** Use "Fit to Page" option or manually set appropriate margins. Consider page orientation (portrait vs landscape).

### Problem: Colors Look Different
