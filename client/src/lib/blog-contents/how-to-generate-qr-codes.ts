QR codes have evolved from simple black-and-white squares to sophisticated marketing tools, payment systems, and information bridges. In 2025, QR codes are essential for contactless interactions, instant information sharing, and seamless digital experiences. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic QR code creation to advanced customization and tracking strategies.

## Quick Answer: How to Generate QR Codes

**To generate a QR code:** Enter your content (URL, text, contact info, WiFi credentials, etc.) into a QR code generator, customize the design (colors, logo, shape), set error correction level (L, M, Q, or H), choose the size (minimum 2x2 cm for print), then download in your preferred format (PNG, SVG, PDF). The process takes seconds and creates instantly scannable codes.

## Understanding QR Code Technology

### What Makes QR Codes Work

QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that store information in a matrix pattern:

\`\`\`
Data Input → Encoding Algorithm → Error Correction → Module Placement → QR Code Pattern
\`\`\`

**Key Components:**
- **Finder Patterns:** Three corner squares for orientation
- **Alignment Patterns:** Help scanners read distorted codes
- **Timing Patterns:** Determine module coordinates
- **Format Information:** Contains error correction level and mask pattern
- **Data Modules:** Store the actual encoded information

### QR Code Specifications

| Version | Modules | Numeric | Alphanumeric | Binary | Kanji |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 21x21 | 41 | 25 | 17 | 10 |
| 10 | 57x57 | 652 | 395 | 271 | 165 |
| 20 | 97x97 | 1,852 | 1,125 | 772 | 470 |
| 40 | 177x177 | 7,089 | 4,296 | 2,953 | 1,817 |
