## Why PDF Protection Matters in 2025

### The Rising Cost of Data Breaches

According to IBM's 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a data breach reached **$4.88 million globally**. PDF documents, often containing sensitive business intelligence, financial data, and personal information, are prime targets for cybercriminals.

**Key Statistics:**
- 60% of breaches involve document theft
- 287 days average time to identify a breach
- $4.88M average breach cost in 2024
- 30% of breaches involve insider threats

### Current Security Threats

**AI-Powered Attacks:** Sophisticated AI tools can now attempt millions of password combinations per second, making weak passwords obsolete.

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Unprotected PDFs shared across business networks create weak points that attackers exploit.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Governments worldwide are implementing stricter data protection laws with severe penalties:
- GDPR (Europe): Fines up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of annual global turnover
- CCPA (California): Penalties of $7,500 per intentional violation
- HIPAA (Healthcare): Fines ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation

## Understanding PDF Encryption

### How PDF Encryption Works

PDF encryption uses mathematical algorithms to scramble your document's content, making it unreadable without the correct password. Modern PDFs use **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** with 128-bit or 256-bit keys.
